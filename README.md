Description
===========

EvoMalware is a BASH script which permits to identify files (PHP only ATM)
infected by malwares/virus/backdoor.  
The main goal is to be used in a cron job to generate reports, but it can be
used in "one shot" mode.  

The script uses 3 flat text files as databases:

* evomalware.filenames, known filenames.
* evomalware.patterns, known patterns.
* evomalware.whitelist, files to ignore.

There is also an "aggresive" mode which permits to find suspect files using
evomalware.suspect DB.  
At each run, the script downloads the last databases.
